HTML-Hypertext Markup Language

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It was developed by Sir Tim Berners Lee in 1990. 

HTML is the standard markup language for creating documents or Web pages designed to be displayed in a web browser. 

HTML describes the structure of a Web page.

HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.

The latest version of HTML is HTML5, being used nowadays.

A webpage is a document, commonly written in HTML, that is viewed in an Web browser.

As HTML is a markup language, so it makes use of various tags to format the content. 

These tags are enclosed within angle braces <Tag Name>. 

They normally come in pairs as follows:
   <tagname>content goes here...</tagname>

For example: for paragraphs, we have <p> and </p> tags. 

HTML tags represents HTML elements, such as paragraph element, or heading element.

  Most of the tags have their corresponding closing tags, except few tags, For example <html> has its closing tag </html> and <body> tag has its closing tag </body> tag etc.

Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.

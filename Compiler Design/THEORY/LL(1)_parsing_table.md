- step 1 : find first and follow 
- $ will always form at last of the table
- if there is epsilion on right side the fill the follow of the follow of the left hand side in our case l'
# how to check weather the grammer is ll(1) or not 
- if there present more than one entry in one cell then it is not a ll(1) grammer and if not then it is .

- there is epsilon at the last so we will check the follow of the left symbol .
- and hence it contains more than one value in one cell therefore it is not a LL(1) grammer.
